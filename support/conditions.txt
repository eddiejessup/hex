% In TeX, the skipped falsey text has an invalid double-else. But because the text is skipped quite naively, only checking for ifs and endifs (ignoring elses), no error is raised.
% This mirrors my implementation, so that's good.
\ifnum1=2   \iftrue \else \else \fi   \else hello \fi
\ifnum1=1 hello \else \or \fi

% In TeX, this will produce nothing. this implies that the first 'else' is inserted after the 'iffy' context has been added, and is considered to apply to the condition-head.
% This mirrors my implementation, so that's good.
\expandafter \else \ifnum1=1 hihi \fi

% This _does_ raise and error, because the extra else is in a block that is not skipped.
% This mirrors my implementation, so that's good.
\ifnum1=1   \iffalse \else \else yo \fi   \else hello \fi


see if:
    true: push state, done
    false: push, skip until see,
        iftok: something
        else: modify state, done
        fi: pop state, done



    \if(P) A \else B \fi
    \if(P) A \fi

parse the if, have remainder:

    A \else B \fi
    A \fi

if P is true:

    push the state 'pre-else'

    then when we see,
        - \else, skip until we see \fi
        - \fi, do nothing
    then pop the state

if P is false:

    skip until,
        - \else, skip that too, to have remainder:

            B \fi

        and push the state 'post-else', so when we see,
            - \else, raise an error
            - \fi, do nothing
        then pop the state

        - \fi, skip that too



  if   if   if   \fi   \fi   \else
