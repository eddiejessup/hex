-- Notation:
-- - An 'Acceptable' line is one that can be realistically considered as being
--   part of an acceptable paragraph.
-- - A 'Promising' line is one that is bare enough that it is either
--   'acceptable' now, or may be acceptable in the future. Conversely, a line
--   that is not promising is one that is so full that it isn't acceptable now,
--   and will never become acceptable. We can remove such edges from
--   consideration, because we know that once a line is not promising, it will
--   never become acceptable.
