-- The lig/kern array contains instructions explaining how to handle special
-- letter pairs. Each instruction consists of four bytes:
-- * skip_byte: Skip this many intervening steps to reach the next step. If
--   >= 128, indicates that this is the final program step.
-- * next_char: If this character follows the current character in the input,
--   then perform the given operation and stop. Otherwise, continue.
-- * op_byte: If < 128, indicates a ligature step. Otherwise, indicates a kern step.
-- * remainder: Argument for the ligature or kern instruction.
-- # Kern step instructions:
--
-- Insert an additional space equal to:
--     kern[256 * (op_byte + 128) + remainder]
-- between the current character and next characters in the input. This amount
-- can be negative, bringing the characters closer together, or positive,
-- pushing them apart.
-- # Ligature step instructions:
--
-- There are eight kinds of ligature steps, with 'op_byte' codes:
--     4a + 2b + c
-- where
--     0 <= a <= b + c
--     0 <= b
--     c in [0, 1]
-- * Insert the character with code 'remainder', between the current and next characters
-- * If 'b = 0', delete the current character
-- * If 'c = 0', delete the next character
-- * Pass over 'a' characters in the input to reach the next current character.
--   (This character may have its own ligature/kerning program).
-- Note that:
-- * if 'a = 0' and 'b = 1', the current character is unchanged
-- * if 'a = b' and 'c = 1', the current character is changed but the next character is unchanged.
-- # Boundary characters.
--
-- TeX puts implicit characters at the left and right boundaries of each
-- consecutive string of characters from the same font. These characters do not
-- appear in the output, but they can affect ligatures and kerning.
--
-- If the first instruction of the lig/kern array has 'skip_byte = 255', that
-- instruction's 'next_char' is the right-boundary character of
-- this font. The value of 'next_char' need not lie between the smallest and
-- largest character codes in the font, according to the TFM file.
-- If the last instruction of the lig/kern array has 'skip_byte = 255', there
-- is a special ligature/kerning program for a left-boundary character,
-- beginning at location:
--     256 * op_byte + remainder
-- # Optional larger lig/kern arrays
--
-- If the first instruction of a character's 'lig_kern' program has
-- 'skip_byte > 128', the program actually begins in location:
--     256 * op_byte + remainder
-- This allows large lig/kern arrays, because the first
-- instruction must otherwise appear in a location that is <= 255.
-- Any instruction with 'skip_byte > 128' in the lig/kern array must satisfy:
--     256 * op_byte + remainder < nl
-- Where 'nl' is the number of words in the lig/kern table. If such an
-- instruction is encountered during program execution, it denotes an
-- unconditional halt, without performing a ligature command.
